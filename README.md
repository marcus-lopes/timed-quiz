# Description

My motivation to start this project is to gain more experience for my career.

## Installation

-Initiation-

When I started this project, I had the intention of doing a quiz to test a person's knowledge of a certain subject.

# Usage

![alt text](./photos/quiz%20picture.png)
On this site we have a "quiz", when you open the page there is a button to start the quiz. When the quiz is started, a series of questions are added (whenever one is answered, this question disappears and a new one is added to the screen.
If the time runs out and the person has not answered all the questions, a sentence saying "YOU LOST" is displayed.
If the person answered all the questions, the result of the quiz appears.
